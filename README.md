# CLI Rust Guessing Game ðŸ¦€


The following code has been written according to the instructions
from the Rust docs.
Nevertheless I learned a lot from it and want to share this simple
guessing game with the people ;-)

To run, just execute the complied file in <i>/target/release/guessing-game</i>
and enjoy the CLI adventure.
